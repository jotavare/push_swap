## ABOUT
In this project, I developed a sorting algorithm for a specific problem using two stacks. The goal of the project is to efficiently sort a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations.

- [Subject](https://github.com/jotavare/push_swap/blob/master/subject/en_subject_push_swap.pdf) `PDF`
- [References](https://github.com/jotavare/42-resources#02-push_swap) `GitHub`

## HOW TO USE
#### 1º - Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jotavare/push_swap.git
```
#### 2º - Enter the project folder and run `make`
```bash
cd push_swap/push_swap
make
```
#### 3º - Run the code
> If you have problems running the `./checker`, use `chmod 777 ./checker` and try again.
```bash
./push_swap [numbers] | ./checker [numbers]
./push_swap 9 0 -217 2147483647 -2147483648 | ./checker 9 0 -217 2147483647 -2147483648
```
#### 4º - Assign numbers to a variable and run the code
```bash
ARG=["numbers"]; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
ARG="3 0 9 2 -1"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

#### MAKEFILE RULES

`make` - Compile push_swap **mandatory** functions.

`make bonus` - Compile push_swap **bonus** functions.

`make all` - Compile **mandatory** + **bonus** functions.

`make clean` - Delete all .o (object files) files.

`make fclean` - Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.

`make re` - Use rules `fclean` + `all`.


## MANDATORY
#### RULES
> The program is only allowed to work with two stacks, stack A and stack B. All the numbers are initially added to stack A, and B is empty.

Possible actions:
- [x] `pa` **(push A)**: Take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A. Do nothing if B is empty.
- [x] `pb` **(push B)**: Take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B. Do nothing if A is empty.
- [x] `sa` **(swap A)**: Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there are only one or no elements.
- [x] `sb` **(swap B)**: Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there are only one or no elements.
- [x] `ss`: `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- [x] `ra` **(rotate A)**: Shift all elements of stack A up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- [x] `rb` **(rotate B)**: Shift all elements of stack B up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- [x] `rr` : `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- [x] `rra` **(reverse rotate A)**: Shift all elements of stack A down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- [x] `rrb` **(reverse rotate B)**: Shift all elements of stack b down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- [x] `rrr` : `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.

#### GRADE
> The grade depends on how efficient the program's sorting process is.
 
- [x] Sorting **3 values**: no more than **3 actions**.
- [x] Sorting **5 values**: no more than **12 actions**.
- [x] Sorting **100 values**: **rating from 1 to 5 points** depending on the number of actions:

   - [ ] **5 points** for less than **700 actions**.
   - [ ] **4 points** for less than **900 actions**.
   - [x] **3 points** for less than **1100 actions**.
   - [x] **2 points** for less than **1300 actions**.
   - [x] **1 point** for less than **1500 actions**.
- [x] Sorting **500 values**: **rating from 1 to 5 points** depending on the number of actions:

   - [ ] **5 points** for less than **5500 actions**.
   - [x] **4 points** for less than **7000 actions**.
   - [x] **3 points** for less than **8500 actions**.
   - [x] **2 points** for less than **10000 actions**.
   - [x] **1 point** for less than **11500 actions**.

> Note: Validating the project requires at least 80/100. I believe 3 points with 100 and 500 numbers would be 80/100.

#### ERROR MANAGEMENT
> The program should print `Error` + `\n` if the following tests are made:

- [x] Non-numeric parameters.
- [x] Duplicate numeric parameter.
- [x] Numeric parameter greater than INT_MAX.
- [x] Numeric parameter less than INT_MIN.

```bash
./push_swap 4 bb 2
./push_swap 4 4 5
./push_swap 4 2 2147483648
./push_swap 4 2 -2147483649
```

#### SORTED EXAMPLES
> Should not print anything if the following tests are made:

- [x] No parameter.
- [x] Single numeric argument.
- [x] The numbers are already sorted.

```bash
./push_swap
./push_swap 42
./push_swap 0 1 2 3
./push_swap 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

## BONUS
- [ ] Create a checker for push_swap that will read the program instructions and display `KO` or `OK`.

## NORMINETTE
> At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ...
